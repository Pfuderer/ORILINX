Overview
--------

ORILINX is a large language model built on DNABERT-2 to detect the location of replication origins in mammalian genomes.

ORILINX is under active development by the `Boemo Group <https://www.boemogroup.org/>`_ based in the `Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge <https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/>`_.  We aim to push regular updates and improvements and incorporating new functionality is an active area of our computational research.
